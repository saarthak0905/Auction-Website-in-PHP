# Auction-Website-in-PHP
This is a website made in php without much CSS and offers the functionality of Putting up items for auction and then bidding on other people items, the website needs basically three tables.
I have used 3 MySQL tables: users, items and bids for which I have created appropriate columns and values from the website.
